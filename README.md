# Me and his App
I am a CS computer science sophomore with a passion for technology and programming. I have developed a solid foundation in various programming languages and problem-solving skills. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience in the field of computer science and software engineering.

Through my self-learning and the help form my mentor, I developed a weather app as my first intern project, using flutter, which provides real-time weather information to users. The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and forecast for the upcoming days.

# Functions

- Scroll down to refresh api data 
- Fetch api weather from a free service
